* Abstract
The positioning of Model Informed Drug Development as the quantitative basis for modern drug development is well understood and accepted in commercial practice and regulatory evaluation of new drug candidates. [MIDD Paper]

The gap between acceptance of the practice and efficient implementation and application of modeling and simulation in drug development can remain a barrier to adoption and delivery for many organizations.

* Outline
** The potential of MIDD
** How does an analyst get started in my role company in applying/industrialization of MIDD?
** Ideal characteristics of MIDD technology and infrastructure environment

The characteristics of an ideal environment supporting delivery of MIDD should consider some of the following elements.

*** Traceability

*** Flexibility/Modularity 

*** Discoverability

*** Reproducibility

*** Usability

*** Compatibility

*** Security

*** Maintainability

*** Supportability

*** Characteristic Examples

| Characteristic         | Examples                                                                                                           |
|------------------------+--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Traceability           | - Source of contributing elements to an IB update/any regulatory document                                          |
|                        | - Identify sources informing Clinical Milestone Decisions / Submissions                                            |
| Flexibility/Modularity | - Introduce new Modeling Workflows from existing Systems, Tools creating new methodologies                         |
| Discoverability        | - Locate MIDD Results contributing to Label Statements and existing model types                                    |
| Reproducibility        | - Full environment information for an analysis for 5+ years ago                                                    |
|                        | - Reproduce results with original or updated tools, environments                                                   |
| Usability              | - New user is ready to run analysis in 1 week                                                                      |
|                        | - New tool is seamlessly added to environment                                                                      |
|                        | - Tool update testing automation                                                                                   |
| Compatibility          | - Creating complete automation workflows as with visual representation of relationships between steps/data/reports |
| Security               | - Control access/share blinded/restricted data in alignment with policy/SOP                                        |
| Maintainability        | - As new features become available for existing tools, they are rapidly rolled out to users                        |
| Supportability         | - Fast resolution to even non-critical user issues                                                                 |
|                        | - Efficient use of expertise, reduce business effort                                                               |

** Ideal components of an MIDD technology and instrastructure environment
*** Repository system
**** Artifact management
**** artifact versioning
**** Security/access control features
**** system validation/qualification repository
**** analysis tools validation/qualification repository
*** Library of standard codes/models/etc
*** Direct connection to compute environments (cloud/internal cluster/etc.)
*** Quality system
*** reporting capabilities
     preferably a reporting system that incorporates traceability to source components and outcomes (modeling results, reports, diagnostics, etc.)

** Use cases
*** Clinical PKPD
*** Preclinical PKPD
*** Application of MIDD
*** Application of EQDD (Enhanced Quantitative Decision Making - Ken Kowalski PTS approaches)
*** Application for QSP
** What do I need to prepare for internal/external regulatory audits?
*** do I need to do anything?
*** what does my organization do?
** Controlled Environment (Traceability)
*** Commercial systems
*** Can I get by with
**** a github account?
**** internal github/gitea server
**** how?
** Elements of Reproducibility
*** How does one get started?
** How to influence your environment/IT 
** Computation Environment Options
*** Local/Laptop - how much can you achieve
*** Small Server
*** Cloud
**** Platforms: Azure/AWS/Google/Oracle 
** Validation/Qualification?
*** Current Standards:
The [[https://github.com/pharmaR/white_paper][R Validation Hub White Paper]] discusses the importance of considering infrastructure and software/tools validation separately and focuses on
the validation of software validation with a focus on the R programming language (reference) specifically. Within this section this paper
provides some of the considerations required for developing and maintaining a qualified infrastructure environment and its relationship
to an audit ready MIDD platform and the PKPD/analysis tools it supports.

*** Do I need to do this?
*** Who does it?
*** What documentation?
*** For PKPD Tools too?
*** Just for my compute environment?
*** How much information do I need to maintain for my compute environment?
** Backup strategies??????
** Resources to get started
*** ISoP of course
